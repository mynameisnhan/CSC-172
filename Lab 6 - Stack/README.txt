Lab 6: Stack

=== SYNOPSIS ===
In CSC 172 lab, we are learning about stacks. The stack was created by copying and pasting everything used in SLL, editing the methods for insert and delete so that creation and removal of nodes would occur at the head instead of at the tail of the SLL, and creating the method to peek at the first element in the SLL. The stack implementation was created to call methods of the SLL implementation.
