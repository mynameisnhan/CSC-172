Lab 7: Queue

=== SYNOPSIS ===
In CSC 172 lab, we are learning about queues. The queue was created by copying and pasting everything used in DLL, editing the method for delete so that removal of nodes will occur at the head of the DLL, and creating the method to peek at the first element in the DLL. The queue implementation was created to call methods of the DLL implementation.
