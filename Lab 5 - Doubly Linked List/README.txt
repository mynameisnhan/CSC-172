Lab 5: Doubly Linked List

=== SYNOPSIS ===
In CSC 172 lab, we are learning about doubly linked lists. The DLL was created using a node class and an interface, both of which were given. The DLL was created by modifying SinglyLinkedListImplementation.java from Lab 4. Compared to the implementation of SLL, the implementation of DLL contained variables for both the head and the tail, edited methods for insert and delete that accounted for reverse traversal, and printListRev, which prints via reverse traversal. 

OUTPUT.txt: Contains output for Test.java
DLLNode.java = Contains node class
DLLInterface.java = Contains interface for DLL
DLL.java = Contains DLL implementation that extends DLLInterface.java
Test.java = Contains test program
